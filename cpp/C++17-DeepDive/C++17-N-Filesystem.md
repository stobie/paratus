### Introduction - What has C++17 given us?

- What's on the way for C++ regarding parallelism and concurrency
- Why std::thread is not enough
- What are the execution policies
- How to run parallel algorithms
- Which algorithms were parallelized
- What the new algorithms are
- Expected performance of parallel execution
- Examples of parallel execution and benchmarks

Multithreading is a significant aspect of modern C++. In the C++ Committee, there's a separate group - "SG1, Concurrency" that works on bringing more features like this to the standard.

What's on the way?

- Coroutines
- Atomic Smart pointers
- Transactional Memory
- Barriers
- Tasks blocks
- Parallelism
- Compute
- Executors
- Heterogeneous programming models support

## P: Other Changes in the Library

This part of the course briefly summarises other changes in the Standard Library:

- What's <span style="color: red;">std::byte</span>?
- What are the new functionalities of maps and sets
- New algorithms: sampling
- Special Mathematical Functions
- Shared Pointers and Arrays
- Non-member <span style="color: red;">size()</span>, <span style="color: red;">data()</span> and <span style="color: red;">empty()</span>
- <span style="color: red;">constexpr</span> additions to the Standard Library
- How to lock multiple mutexes with <span style="color: red;">scoped_lock</span>?
- What's a polymorphic allocator? How can it help with memory management?
