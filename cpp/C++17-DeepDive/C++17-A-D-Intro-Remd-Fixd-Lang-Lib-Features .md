# C++17 in Detail: A Deep Dive

## A: Introduction
==================================================================

The code you've seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg! Read the next chapters to see much more: fixes in the language, clarifications, removed things (like auto_ptr), and of course the new stuff such as:

- constexpr lambda
- if constexpr
- fold expressions
- structured bindings
- template<auto>,
- inline
- variables
- template argument deduction for class templates


## B: Removed of Fixed Language Features
==================================================================

https://www.educative.io/courses/cpp-17-in-detail-a-deep-dive/introduction-NE7LOWjZ85m

- What was removed from the language like the "register"  keyword or "operator++" for bool
- What was fixed, notably the auto type deduction with brace initialisation.
- Other improvements like for "static_assert" and range-based for loops.


## C: Removed and Deprecated Library Features
==================================================================

https://www.educative.io/courses/cpp-17-in-detail-a-deep-dive/introduction-m2jODzkPgp0

- Why "auto_ptr" was removed and why you should stick with smart pointers
- Why "std::random_shuffle" algorithm was removed and what's a better alternative for it
- How to implement custom iterator and not derive from deprecated "std::iterator" type
- What are the other smaller elements that were deprecated or removed

`std::iterator` Is Deprecated


## D: Language Clarification
